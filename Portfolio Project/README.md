# My Dynamic Portfolio Web Application

**(Running the Application )**
**Ensure `venv` is active (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`), then run: `python app.py`)**

This project is a **dynamic and interactive personal portfolio web application**, meticulously crafted using Python with the Flask web framework. Its primary purpose is to serve as a modern and engaging platform to showcase my skills, completed projects, and professional experiences to potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work.

The application moves beyond the limitations of static HTML pages by leveraging Python for backend logic, data management (profile details, skills, project information), and routing. Content is dynamically rendered into HTML templates using Jinja2, which allows for easy updates and maintainability. The frontend is built with HTML5 and CSS3, featuring a responsive, dark-themed design with subtle animations and transitions to create a polished and user-friendly experience.

Key highlights include a structured project showcase, a visual representation of skills, and clear navigation, all designed to present a comprehensive professional profile in a clean, efficient, and personalized manner. The development emphasizes a separation of concerns, making the codebase organized and scalable for future enhancements.
